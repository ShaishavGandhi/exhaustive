Exhaustive
==========

An annotation and Kotlin compiler plugin for enforcing a `when` statement is exhaustive.

```kotlin
enum class RouletteColor { Red, Black, Green }

fun printColor(color: RouletteColor) {
  @Exhaustive
  when (color) {
    Red -> println("red")
    Black -> println("black")
  }
}
```
```
e: Example.kt:5: @Exhaustive when is not exhaustive!

Missing branches:
- RouletteColor.Green
```

No more assigning to dummy local properties or referencing pointless functions or properties to
force the `when` to be an expression for exhaustiveness checking. The plugin reuses the same check
that is used for a `when` expression.

In addition to being forced to be exhaustive, an annotated `when` statement is forbidden from using
an `else` branch.

```kotlin
fun printColor(color: RouletteColor) {
  @Exhaustive
  when (color) {
    Red -> println("red")
    Black -> println("black")
    else -> println("green")
  }
}
```
```
e: Example.kt:5: @Exhaustive when must not contain an 'else' branch
```

The presence of an `else` block indicates support for a default action. The exhaustive check would
otherwise always pass with this branch which is why it is disallowed.

Sealed classes are also supported.

```kotlin
sealed class RouletteColor {
  object Red : RouletteColor()
  object Black : RouletteColor()
  object Green : RouletteColor()
}

fun printColor(value: RouletteColor) {
  @Exhaustive
  when (value) {
    RouletteColor.Red -> println("red")
    RouletteColor.Black -> println("black")
  }
}
```
```
e: Example.kt:9: @Exhaustive when is not exhaustive!

Missing branches:
- RouletteColor.Green
```

Vote for [youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-12380](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-12380)
to see this added to the Kotlin language (with a better syntax).


Usage
-----

```groovy
buildscript {
  dependencies {
    classpath 'app.cash.exhaustive:exhaustive-gradle:0.1.0'
  }
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
  }
}

apply plugin: 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm' // or .android or .multiplatform or .js
apply plugin: 'app.cash.exhaustive'
```

The `@Exhaustive` annotation will be made available in your main and test source sets but will not
be shipped as a dependency of the module.
